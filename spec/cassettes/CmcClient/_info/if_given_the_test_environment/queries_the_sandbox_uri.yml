        digital currency. Powered by its users, it is a peer to peer payment network
        that requires no central authority to operate. On October 31st, 2008, an individual
        or group of individuals operating under the pseudonym \"Satoshi Nakamoto\"
        published the Bitcoin Whitepaper and described it as: \"a purely peer-to-peer
        version of electronic cash, which would allow online payments to be sent directly
        from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\"","notice":null,"date_added":"2013-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"date_launched":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}}}'
