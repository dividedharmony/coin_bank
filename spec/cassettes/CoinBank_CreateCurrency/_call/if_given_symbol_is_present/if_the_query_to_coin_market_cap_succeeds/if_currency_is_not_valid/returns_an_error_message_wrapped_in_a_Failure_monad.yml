        digital currency. Powered by its users, it is a peer to peer payment network

        or group of individuals operating under the pseudonym \"Satoshi Nakamoto\"
        published the Bitcoin Whitepaper and described it as: \"a purely peer-to-peer

        from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\"","notice":null,"date_added":"2013-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":["mineable"],"date_launched":null,"platform":null,"category":"coin"}}}'
